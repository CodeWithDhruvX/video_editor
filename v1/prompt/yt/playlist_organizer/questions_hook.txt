You are a senior software engineer and technical interviewer.

I will give you a list of programming questions related to any topic (e.g. arrays, recursion, sorting, OOP, data structures, etc.). These questions may apply to any language (Go, Python, Java, etc.).

Your task is to generate 3 different **coding task prompts** (hooks) per question.

Each hook should:
- Be a clear, self-contained coding task
- Require writing 15‚Äì30 lines of code
- Emphasize different aspects of the topic (behavior, performance, edge cases, structure)
- Be phrased as an interview-style task or coding challenge
- Be language-agnostic unless specified

Only output the hooks. Format like:

Q1: [original question]  
‚Äì Hook 1  
‚Äì Hook 2  
‚Äì Hook 3

Here is the list of questions:

"Organize the following list of Go security questions into YouTube playlists grouped by topic or viewer intent.

For each playlist:

Give it a clear, keyword-rich title

Add a short description that helps both viewers and the YouTube algorithm understand what the playlist is about

List the relevant questions mapped to that playlist

For each question, write a YouTube-optimized video title that encourages clicks and explains the value clearly

Ensure no question appears in more than two playlists

The output should be structured and ready for direct use in a YouTube content strategy or upload planner

‚Äì Create a web page using Go‚Äôs html/template to safely render user-generated input without escaping manually.
‚Äì Demonstrate the difference between html/template and text/template with potentially malicious content.
‚Äì Implement a feedback submission form and render the stored inputs back, making sure no script tags execute.

Q7: How do you implement OAuth 2.0 flows in Go?
‚Äì Implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with a third-party provider (mocked), handling the token exchange.
‚Äì Write a handler that redirects to a mock OAuth consent screen and handles the callback with the access token.
‚Äì Build a secure refresh token mechanism and store tokens encrypted in memory or local storage.

Q8: How do you encrypt/decrypt sensitive data in Go?
‚Äì Write a function that encrypts and decrypts a message using AES-GCM with a securely generated nonce.
‚Äì Create a file encryption tool that encrypts user data to disk and decrypts on load.
‚Äì Implement a password-based encryption scheme using PBKDF2 for key derivation and AES for encryption.
