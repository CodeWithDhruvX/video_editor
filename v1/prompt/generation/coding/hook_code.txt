I want you to:
1. Generate 10 viral YouTube Shorts ideas that are focused on following interview Q&A, pitfalls, or coding challenges. Each idea must have:


A killer hook in the first 3 seconds.
A clear structure for 30â€“60 seconds (problem > solution > quick tip).
A call-to-action (like comment, share, or watch next).
2. Suggest 5 click-worthy titles and thumbnails for each idea (SEO + curiosity-based).

3. Provide 1 full 30-second script for the highest potential idea.

===========================================================================

You are to transform the following list of technical interview video ideas into a JSON array of objects.

ðŸŽ¯ Output Format (MUST follow exactly):
{
  "snippets": [
    {
      "title": "<short descriptive title>",
      "code": "<programming langauge name, fully self-contained, short (20â€“25 sec reading), minimal inline comments (1â€“3 words), highlight pitfall if relevant, include // Output comment>",
      "hook": "<1-line retention hook>"
    }
  ]
}

ðŸ“œ Rules for the code:
- Language: programming language
- Must be self-contained, runnable, and short
- Use clear minimal inline comments
- Show `// Output: ...` for expected result
- If there is a pitfall, show Expected vs Actual in comments
- No external packages unless required by the example
- Format with proper indentation and escape quotes for JSON
- Before writing any code, insert a comment containing the programming language name. Use the correct comment syntax for that language (e.g., # Python for Python, // Go for Go, /* Java */ for Java), and ensure the comment is properly aligned according to the languageâ€™s style guidelines.
